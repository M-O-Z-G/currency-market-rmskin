This rainmeter skin shows currency prices from [INO.com](https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.ino.com). You'll need at least the **4.2 Final Release** version of rainmeter which you can get from [Rainmeter.net](https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://rainmeter.net/).

You can change the currencies monitored by right-clicking anywhere on the skin -> Edit Currency Pairs.

The prices roll-up out of sight when you click on the top-left icon. Click on the name of the currency pair to open the summary page on ino.com.
